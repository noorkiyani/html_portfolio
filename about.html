<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is NOOR, I’ve been studying computer science for about 1 year.
In order to kick-start my career before I graduate, I am looking for a job of a web developer, since that’s what I’ve been doing already for quite long in my free time. Designing websites for friends with the help of some open source content-management systems, and so on.
Besides that I am a normal girl who enjoys reading books and spending time with some close friends and family, while not working or studying, which takes most of my time of course.
If I should pick the best website I’ve designed up to this point, it will be this one which is as well as my portfolio.</p>
